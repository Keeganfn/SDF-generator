# sdf-generator
Generates a signed distance field over the volume of a cube for a .obj mesh file using trimesh. 


TODO:
Currently is set up as a class, need to add the ability to save the 3d SDF array to a file and a command line interface. Also need to clean it up and adjust certain return values and the way the cube is centerd on the object.
